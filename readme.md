# Round Rectangle Fusion 360 Plug In

## Description

Creates a rounded square at a point. Same as creating a center rectangle, filleting all the corners and giving dimensions to the length, width and fillet radius.
The shape can be handled then as if these operations were done in the drawing.

## Instalation

Open Fusion, go to scripts and add-ins (shift+s) and create a new add-in. Select python as language and copy "RoundedSquare.py" there. 

From the add-inns and scripts windows load it.

## Usage

From a sketch, create a point a and then click on "create > draw rounded square" from the topbar. Select the default size acording to the metric carriage bolt square necks, select the target point and click ok.

Feel free to edit the script to add own frequently used sizes.
